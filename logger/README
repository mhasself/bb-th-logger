set_time.php
============

To install the time-setting web tool, run:

  make install_web

Then point your browser to 192.168.7.2:8080/enviro/set_time.php.


For set_time.php to work, you probably will have to do two other things:

1) Install the PHP plugin for the webserver:

   apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

2) Make it so that the web server is allowed to set the system time.
We accomplish this by setting the SUID bit of the "date" executable so
that it always run with root priveleges, no matter what user invokes
it:

   chmod u+s /bin/date

This is a terrible security breach.
